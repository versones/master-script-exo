# master-script-exo

This script was created to make it easier to manage certain Exchange Online functions.
There may be some bugs, please report them so it can be fixed.

Inside each function there is a note with the requirement of columns needed for the CSV to execute correctly.
At the moment the script only validates the column "UserPrincipalName"

The script was recently translated from PT-BR to EN-US to help more people.
